This means\n that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\n TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\n https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\n to implement supply mechanisms].\n The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification."

On the other hand, approval changes made by\n `_spendAllowance` during the `transferFrom` operation set the flag to false. This saves gas by not emitting any\n `Approval` event during `transferFrom` operations.\n Anyone who wishes to continue emitting `Approval` events on the`transferFrom` operation can force the flag to\n true using the following override:\n ```\n function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, bool) internal virtual override {\n     super._approve(owner, spender, value, true);\n }\n ```\n Requirements are the same as {_approve}."

To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
